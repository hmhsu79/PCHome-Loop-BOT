# PCHome-Loop-BOT

*This BOT will reload and retry Cart and Go to Cart button until no exception
*Uncomment PO part to buy product automatically
*Username/Password can be omitted if you already login, remove the "option" part, and create driver without chrome_options parameter
*I didn't managed to buy a RTX-3090 mining card on 2021/04/22, consider RESTFul-API
*Anyway, it can be a good buying BOT, and just need some simple hacks to the code
*Good luck
